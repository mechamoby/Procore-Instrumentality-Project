# REI CLONE PROTOCOL

## Trigger
When Nick sends the Rei Ayanami clones image (End of Evangelion Dummy Plug System), saved at `protocols/rei-clone-reset.jpg`.

## Execution
1. **Analyze the entire current session** — extract all key information, decisions, context, progress, blockers, and anything worth preserving.
2. **Create a document** storing all key information in `memory/rei-dumps/` with filename `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-rei-dump.md`.
3. **Confirm completion** to Nick.
4. Nick will purge the chat history to reset context.

## Rules
- This is a **core protocol** — never delete.
- Capture everything that matters. When in doubt, include it.
- The dump is the only surviving record of the session — treat it accordingly.
