# NERV Database Test — 1750 ODP Residential Lobby Elevation Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Target:** Finished Floor Elevation (FF/NGVD) for Residential Lobby (L01-024), Level 01  
**Files Analyzed:** 14 DXF files (A-101 through A-128, floor plans + RCPs)

---

## Executive Summary

**❌ The finished floor elevation (NGVD) for the Residential Lobby is NOT contained in these 14 architectural floor plan/RCP sheets.**

These sheets contain only horizontal (plan view) information. Elevation data (NGVD, FF elevations, slab elevations) would be found on:
- **Structural sheets** (S-series) — slab elevations per level
- **Civil/Site sheets** (C-series) — NGVD benchmarks, site grading
- **Building Sections** (A-200 series) — level datums with NGVD
- **Elevation sheets** (A-300 series) — exterior elevation datums

---

## What We Found

### 1. Residential Lobby Location (Confirmed)
- **Sheet:** A-101 (Level 01 Floor Plan)
- **Room ID:** L01-024
- **Room Name:** RESIDENTIAL LOBBY
- **Coordinates:** (-225, -1722) on layer A-AREA-IDEN
- **Adjacent rooms:** Elevator (L01-015), Move-In Room (L01-020), Trash (L01-012)

### 2. Elevation-Related Data Found

| Finding | Source | Significance |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| "ALL ELEVATIONS ARE RELATIVE TO TOP OF SLAB ELEVATION OF " | A-121 RCP Notes (G-ANNO-TEXT) | **Truncated** — the actual elevation value is missing from the MTEXT entity. Revit export artifact. |
| 6.10% slope with "DN" direction | A-101, near lobby entrance (G-ANNO-DIMS) | Ramp slopes down toward lobby from exterior — implies grade change |
| "DN" on A-FLOR-LEVL-TEXT layer | A-101, at (-345, -1499) | Confirms directional level change near lobby |
| A-FLOR-LEVL layer | A-101 | Contains 25 LINE entities (ramp slope indicators) but NO text/elevation values |
| A-FLOR-LEVL-TEXT layer | A-101 | Contains only "DN" text — no numerical elevations |
| Section markers "A2" | A-101, multiple locations near lobby | Reference building sections that would show vertical datums (sheets not provided) |

### 3. Layers Analyzed
Elevation-relevant layers found across all files:
- `A-FLOR-LEVL` — Floor level lines (slope indicators only)
- `A-FLOR-LEVL-TEXT` — Floor level text ("DN" only)
- `A-ANNO-NOTE` — Annotations ("FD" = floor drain markers)
- `A-ANNO-DIMS` — Dimensions (horizontal measurements + slope percentages)
- `G-ANNO-TEXT` — General notes (RCP notes with truncated elevation reference)
- `G-ANNO-SYMB` — Symbols
- `S-STRS-ANNO` — Structural annotations (stair "UP" labels only)

### 4. Block Analysis
- **2,879 INSERT entities** with elevation-related block names analyzed
- All are Revit-exported component blocks (doors, railings, mullions)
- Block names contain "LEVEL 01" etc. as Revit view references, NOT elevation values
- **Zero block attributes (ATTRIB)** found in any file — Revit exported without attributes

### 5. Vision Analysis (Rendered DXF)
AI vision analysis of the rendered lobby area confirmed:
- No spot elevation symbols (circle with crosshair)
- No FF elevation callouts
- No NGVD references visible
- Numbers in circles/diamonds are door tags (133, 397, 660), not elevations

## What Sheets Are Needed

To obtain the Residential Lobby FF elevation, request from Nick:

1. **A-200 series (Building Sections)** — Will show level datums with NGVD elevations
2. **S-100 series (Structural Plans)** — Will show top-of-slab elevations per level
3. **C-100 series (Civil/Site)** — Will show NGVD benchmark and site grading at building entry
4. **A-001 or G-001 (General Notes/Abbreviations)** — May contain the complete version of the truncated RCP note "ALL ELEVATIONS ARE RELATIVE TO TOP OF SLAB ELEVATION OF [___]"

### Inference from Available Data
- Level 01 is at grade (ground level) — confirmed by "Ground Level Landscape" label on A-DETL-IDEN layer
- A 6.10% ramp slopes DOWN to the lobby entrance
- The lobby floor is likely at or slightly below exterior grade
- For a typical Miami building (1750 ODP address suggests Miami/Fort Lauderdale), NGVD for ground floor is commonly **+10' to +14' NGVD** depending on flood zone, but this CANNOT be confirmed from these sheets

## Method Applied
1. ✅ Exhaustive DXF text extraction (all 14 files, all layers, all entity types)
2. ✅ Block/INSERT analysis (2,879 elevation-named blocks, 0 attributes)
3. ✅ Block definition inspection (searched for elevation/level/spot/datum block defs)
4. ✅ Dimension text override extraction (128 dimensions — all horizontal measurements)
5. ✅ DXF rendering + AI vision analysis of lobby area
6. ✅ Cross-reference analysis across all 14 sheets
7. ❌ PDF extraction — no PDFs available (files are DWG format)
8. ❌ DWG native parsing — not supported without proprietary libraries
