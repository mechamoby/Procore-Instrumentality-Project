# SEELE — The Organization Behind NERV

SEELE is never client-facing. Clients interact with EVAs through NERV. SEELE is us — the team that makes it all work.

## SEELE's Role
- Pre-deployment: ingest client historical data, structure the database
- Soul configuration: craft each EVA's personality to match client culture
- NERV server setup: hardware, networking, security, OpenClaw deployment
- Ongoing maintenance: updates, database optimization, new project ingestion
- New EVA deployment: when a client adds EVA-01, EVA-02, etc.

## SEELE's People
- **Nick Stula** — Founder. 8+ years construction (real estate dev → GC PM). Knows the industry, knows the clients, knows the pain points.
- **Moby** — AI co-founder & agent architect. Builds everything. Designs the souls. Maintains the infrastructure.

## The SEELE Process (Client Onboarding)
1. Sales conversation (Nick) — understand client's projects, pain points, team structure
2. Data collection — request historical project data (Procore export, file shares, etc.)
3. Database build (Moby) — parse, categorize, structure all historical data into NERV database
4. Soul calibration — customize EVA personality to match client culture and team dynamics
5. NERV deployment — install server at client site, configure networking, deploy EVAs
6. Training session (Nick + EVA-00) — live demo with client team
7. Go-live support — first 2 weeks of active monitoring and adjustment
