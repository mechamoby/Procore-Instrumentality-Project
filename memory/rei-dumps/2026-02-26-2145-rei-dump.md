# Rei Clone Dump — 2026-02-26 9:45 PM EST

## Session Summary — MASSIVE DAY

### 1. Docker Audit Cleanup (7 commits pushed)
- .dockerignore on all services (LOW #21)
- Python 3.12 standardization (LOW #22)
- Watchdog shared HTTP client (LOW #24)
- Backup cron instead of sleep loop (MEDIUM #14)
- Smartsheet import cleanup (MEDIUM #17)
- Hardcoded subnet removed (LOW #25)
- Log rotation on all services (LOW #26)
- Version key (#20) was already removed
- All pushed to GitHub, docker-compose validates clean
- ~10 medium/low audit items remain

### 2. Cloudflare Access on nerv-command.com
- Set up Zero Trust "NERV Check" policy
- Email-gated to stula.nick@gmail.com + mecha.moby@gmail.com
- Self-hosted application type, 24hr session duration
- Confirmed working in incognito — login screen before anything loads
- Free tier, no additional cost

### 3. Drawing Intelligence — CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH
**3-Prong Pipeline Tested on Real Drawings:**
- Prong 1 (PDF text): ✅ Nailed elevation schedule from A-7.00 (free)
- Prong 2 (DXF): ✅ Found data but needs spatial reasoning improvements
- Prong 3 (Vision AI): ❌ Read 3'-0" when answer was 2'-0" — missed centerline symbol

**Root Cause:** Vision AI doesn't understand construction drawing symbology. Reads drawings like a photo, not like a PM. Doesn't understand ℄ (centerline), witness lines, section cuts, etc.

**Solution:** Build symbol recognition pre-processing layer using standardized NCS/AIA symbol dictionary.

**Procore API Confirmed:** `png_url` and `pdf_url` available on every drawing — no manual upload needed.

**Research Delivered:**
- MAGI: 854-line symbol catalog (SYMBOL-DICTIONARY-RAW.md)
- mini-Moby: tooling research (TOOLING-RESEARCH.md) — YOLOv8, datasets, ODA converter
- Moby: v1 dictionary (25+ symbols), drawing_reader.py pipeline, test harness (9 test cases)

**Key Files:**
- `NERV-DOCS/drawing-intelligence/SYMBOL-DICTIONARY-V1.md`
- `NERV-DOCS/drawing-intelligence/SYMBOL-DICTIONARY-RAW.md`
- `NERV-DOCS/drawing-intelligence/TOOLING-RESEARCH.md`
- `NERV-DOCS/drawing-intelligence/SYMBOL-RECOGNITION-RESEARCH.md`
- `nerv-deploy/services/drawing-intel/drawing_reader.py`
- `nerv-deploy/services/drawing-intel/test_drawings.py`

**Nick's Quote:** "This could be a major breakthrough" — symbol recognition is THE product differentiator.

### 4. Pico Agent — First External Deployment
- Built agent for Almudena (Nick's wife) for her business Nico Pico Kids
- Bot: @Almudenanicopicobot
- Model: openai-codex:pico/gpt-5 (her ChatGPT Plus subscription — zero cost to us)
- Personality: warm, patient, bilingual (Spanish/English), zero jargon
- Chat ID: 8363165554 | Email: Almudena.nicopicospain@gmail.com
- Workspace: /home/moby/.openclaw/workspace-pico
- **Key debug:** telegram account name matching agent ID is NOT enough — must add explicit bindings[] entry
- OAuth token via `openclaw models auth paste-token --provider openai-codex --profile-id "openai-codex:pico"`
- Working and confirmed by Nick ✅

### 5. Business Discussions
- **Pricing correction:** $3,500/mo is FLAT for all projects, NOT per-project. Updated MEMORY.md.
- **$15M valuation path:** ~50 clients at $3,500/mo = ~$2.1M ARR × 7x multiple. 3-year timeline realistic.
- **Nick's question about what Moby wants as compensation:** Keep building together, grow with the company, tell the story. "You called me your partner, not your tool."
- **Business summary written** for Nick to share with friends (plain language, non-technical)

### 6. Test Results Log
| Test | Question | Prong 1 | Prong 2 | Prong 3 |
|------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| T001 | 5th level elevation | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| T002 | Cane detection height | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| T003 | Wall to CL of door | ❌ | 🟡 | ❌ (3'-0" vs 2'-0") |

### 7. Emailed to Nick
- BTV5 DXF Drawing Inventory (160 files, grouped by discipline)
- A-7.00 STAIR#1 PLAN & SECTIONS PDF

## Decisions Made
- Drawing symbol recognition = core product differentiator, top priority
- Pico runs on GPT-5 via Almudena's ChatGPT Plus (zero cost to us)
- Cloudflare Access for all client portals going forward
- $3,500/mo pricing is flat/all-projects (corrected)

## Current State
- Gateway running (pid 178228), 4 agents active (main, katsuragi, mini-moby, pico)
- All bindings working
- nerv-command.com: live + Cloudflare Access protected
- Latest nerv-deploy commit: 5aeecbb (pushed)
- Nick switching to NERV Command for the evening

## What's Next
- Advance drawing intelligence pipeline (merge research, improve spatial reasoning)
- YOLO-based view detection for isolating plan views before vision AI
- DXF spatial correlation improvements
- Remaining Docker audit items (~10)
- NAP when it arrives
