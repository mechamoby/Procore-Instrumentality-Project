# Rei Clone Dump — 2026-02-24 ~9:10 PM (Telegram Session)

## Session Summary
Post-NERV-Command session on Telegram. Mostly continuity setup + NAP kickoff.

## Key Items

### 1. Context Reset Discovery
- Nick manually cleared Telegram chat → context dropped from 80% to 9%
- Telegram auto-delete is set to 24 hours — context bloat is same-day only
- Bots can't bulk-delete; Nick must purge from app

### 2. Rei Clone Protocol Formalized
- Created `protocols/REI-CLONE-RESET.md` — canonical protocol file
- Created `memory/rei-dumps/` folder
- Protocol: analyze session → dump to rei-dumps → confirm → Nick purges chat
- Old MEMORY.md inline description replaced with pointer to protocol file

### 3. Session Handoff Confirmed Working
- Read `memory/handoff.md` — full NERV session context loaded successfully
- Read `NERV-DOCS/SESSION-EXPORT-2026-02-24-NERV.md` — full 3-hour transcript preserved
- Cross-session handoff protocol is validated and working

### 4. NAP 02.24.2026 — Initiated
- Ledger created: `memory/nap/2026-02-24-NAP.md`
- 5 tasks in priority order:
  1. OpenClaw updates — **DONE** (updated to 2026.2.24, gateway restarted)
  2. Review NERV export for improvements — read complete, analysis pending
  3. MAGI deep-dive on PM document management + refine DB architecture
  4. Improve NERV Command Interface
  5. Easter eggs — "another Evangelion happens"
- Nick screenshotted my confidence estimates (90% tasks 1-3, 70% task 4, bonus task 5)

### 5. MEMORY.md Updates
- Added Telegram Settings section (auto-delete 24h, context management)
- Rei Clone Reset entry simplified to pointer to protocol file
- Duplicate Telegram Settings section existed — noted for cleanup

## State at Session End
- OpenClaw updated to 2026.2.24
- Gateway restarted (may have had a hiccup — synthetic error in logs)
- NAP execution overnight — heartbeats should drive tasks 2-5
- Nick going to sleep, expects morning report ~6 AM
