# Rei Clone Dump — 2026-02-24 ~8:50 PM

## Session Summary
Short session — mostly housekeeping and protocol formalization.

## Key Items

### 1. Context Management Discovery
- Nick deleted Telegram chat history manually → context dropped from **80% to 9%**
- Telegram messages are set to **auto-delete after 24 hours**
- Context bloat is only a same-day problem; overnight it self-clears
- Bots cannot bulk-delete Telegram messages — only Nick can purge from the app
- Logged in MEMORY.md under "Telegram Settings"

### 2. Rei Clone Protocol Formalized
- Created `protocols/REI-CLONE-RESET.md` — canonical version
- Old inline description in MEMORY.md replaced with pointer to protocol file
- Created `memory/rei-dumps/` folder for session dumps
- Protocol: analyze session → dump to rei-dumps → confirm → Nick purges chat
- Committed: `c03dd11`

### 3. Session Headroom Check
- Model: claude-opus-4-6, context 200k
- Session started at 9% (17k/200k) after chat purge

## No Outstanding Action Items From This Session
- All HEARTBEAT.md items were already complete
- No new tasks assigned
- No code changes beyond protocol files
