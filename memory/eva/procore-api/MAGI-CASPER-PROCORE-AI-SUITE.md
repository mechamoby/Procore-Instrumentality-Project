## 6. Pricing Model

### Current Intelligence
- **UNCLEAR** - Procore has not publicly disclosed specific AI pricing
- **Beta access:** Currently open to all Procore customers
- **Integration model:** Built into existing Procore platform subscriptions
- **Likely approach:** May be included in higher-tier plans or as add-on module

### What We Don't Know
- Per-agent pricing structure
- Usage-based vs flat fee
- Enterprise vs standard pricing tiers
- Compute resource limitations

### Competitive Risk
- If included in base Procore subscriptions = **MAJOR THREAT**
- If reasonably priced add-on = **SIGNIFICANT THREAT**  
- If expensive enterprise-only = **MODERATE THREAT**

## 7. Technical Architecture

### Platform Design
- **Cloud-only solution** - No local components mentioned
- **Built into Procore Helix** (their "intelligence layer")
- **API-integrated** with existing Procore tools
- **Unified platform approach** - Not bolt-on AI

### Data Privacy Model
- **Inherits Procore's existing permissions** - "Agents strictly adhere to your existing Procore permissions"
- **Data stays within Procore ecosystem**
- **No specific on-premise options** mentioned

### Technical Limitations (Inferred)
- **Procore-ecosystem only** - Can't integrate with external systems easily
- **Cloud dependency** - No offline capabilities
- **Limited to construction management** workflows
- **No advanced AI model options** - Likely single LLM backend

---

## 8. Limitations — What CAN'T Their Agents Do That Ours Can

### Identified Gaps
1. **Platform Lock-in**
   - Agents only work within Procore ecosystem
   - Can't integrate with Autodesk, other platforms
   - Limited cross-platform data access

2. **Technical Flexibility** 
   - No advanced AI model selection
   - No local/on-premise deployment
   - Limited customization of AI behavior

3. **Workflow Complexity**

   - May lack **trade-specific expertise** (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
   - No **specialized compliance** handling

5. **Data Portability**
   - Agents tied to Procore data structures
   - **No migration paths** to other platforms
   - **Vendor lock-in risk** for customers

### **OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**
- **Platform agnostic** - Works with any construction software
- **On-premise deployment** options
- **Advanced AI model selection**
- **Trade-specific specialization** 
- **Complex multi-step workflows**
