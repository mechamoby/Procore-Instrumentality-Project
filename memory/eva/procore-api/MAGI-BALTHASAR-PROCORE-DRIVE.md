## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Procore Drive is a **free desktop application** (Windows-only) that serves as Procore's file upload/download solution, replacing the discontinued Procore Sync as of September 2022. It addresses fundamental pain points in construction file management by eliminating reliance on FTP clients and cumbersome file sharing solutions. However, user sentiment reveals it lacks the seamless integration capabilities users desire compared to cloud storage solutions like Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive.
