# EVA Tactical Review — 2026-02-19

## Status Summary

| Component | Status | Readiness |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| EVA Souls (00/01/02/MAGI/SEELE) | Written | 🟡 Need API reality check |
| nerv-deploy repo | Structured | 🟡 Scaffolding, not tested end-to-end |
| NERV Interface | Working | 🟢 Full agent chat via Gateway WS |
| Drawing Index Pipeline | Working | 🟢 BTV5 synced, Tier 1 classification done |
| BTV5 Submittals | Done | 🟢 143 uploaded to sandbox |
| MAGI Agent | Registered | 🔴 Never ran a real sprint (blocked on Procore auth) |
| Procore API Knowledge Base | Started | 🟡 Swagger + 4 endpoint docs, needs depth |
| Client Update System | Built | 🟢 Two-layer souls, update.sh, auto-update.sh |
| Procore OAuth Token | Expired | 🔴 Refresh token dead, needs browser re-auth |

## What Actually Works (Green)

1. **NERV Interface** — Full agent interaction via Gateway WS from browser. Tool calls, file ops, terminal. Tested.
2. **Drawing Index** — BTV5 fully synced from Procore sandbox (230 drawings, 486MB PNGs). Tier 1 classification pipeline proven on 2,008 pages.
3. **BTV5 Submittals** — 143 unique submittals parsed and uploaded to Procore sandbox. Upload script works.
4. **Client Update System** — Two-layer soul architecture (SOUL.md + SOUL-LOCAL.md), update.sh with rollback, auto-update.sh for cron. Solid design.
5. **OpenClaw Infrastructure** — Gateway running, Telegram connected, cron working, subagents functional (after post-update fix).

## What's Scaffolding But Not Tested (Yellow)

1. **nerv-deploy** — 36 files, looks complete (Docker Compose, setup wizard, schema, scripts). BUT:
   - Never actually deployed via `docker compose up`
   - `ghcr.io/evangelion-project/openclaw:latest` image doesn't exist
   - No `openclaw.json` template generated by setup.sh tested
   - Database schema (909 lines) never applied to a real PostgreSQL
   - Agent workspace mounting assumptions untested
   - **Verdict: Demo-grade packaging, not production-tested**

2. **EVA Souls** — Well-written with experiential voice, anti-patterns, domain knowledge. BUT:
   - EVA-00 soul claims capabilities we haven't validated against Procore API
   - EVA-01 (Submittals) references workflow management that Procore API can't do
   - EVA-02 (RFIs) references drawing analysis we haven't built yet
   - Souls promise Procore integration but we don't have working Procore code in the deploy package
   - **Verdict: Great writing, needs grounding in what the API actually supports**

3. **Procore API Knowledge Base** — Swagger file + 4 endpoint docs. Useful but:
   - MAGI never ran its first sprint
   - We know limitations (no spec sections, no workflow/approver mgmt, no user creation for roles)
   - Don't yet know the full scope of what IS possible
   - **Verdict: Need MAGI sprint badly to fill gaps**

## What's Blocked or Missing (Red)

1. **Procore OAuth** — Token expired, refresh token dead. Everything Procore-related is blocked until Nick clicks the auth link. This is THE critical blocker.

2. **MAGI First Sprint** — Can't test endpoints without auth. This agent has never done real work yet.

3. **EVA-00 Actual Code** — We have a soul file and a database schema, but no actual agent code that:
   - Connects to Procore API
   - Ingests project history
   - Queries and cross-references data
   - The "product" doesn't exist yet beyond the soul + schema

4. **No Demo Environment** — We can't show a client anything working. No EVA-00 responding to questions with real project data.

## Known Procore API Limitations (Must Inform Soul Rewrites)

- `drawings` endpoint 404s — must use `drawing_revisions`
- No spec section list/create — UI only, can link by ID
- No submittal workflow/approver management via API
- API-created users can't be submittal managers/reviewers
- Rate limit: 100 req/~60s
- Cover sheet PDFs have signed download links for attachments
- Vendor creation uses `{"vendor": {...}}` not `{"company": {...}}`

## Critical Path to EVA-00 Demo

1. **Procore re-auth** (Nick, 2 min) → unblocks everything
2. **MAGI first sprint** → map Daily Logs, Change Events, Budget, Observations endpoints
3. **EVA-00 core code** → Procore data ingestion + PostgreSQL storage + query interface
4. **Test with BTV5 sandbox data** → prove it works on real-ish project data
5. **Package into nerv-deploy** → actually deploy via Docker
6. **Demo script** → show a PM asking EVA-00 about their project and getting instant answers

## Priority Order — Next Sprint

1. 🔴 **Procore OAuth re-auth** (blocker, needs Nick)
2. 🟠 **MAGI deep dive** — Daily Logs, Change Events, Submittals detail, RFI detail endpoints
3. 🟠 **EVA-00 MVP code** — even a basic "ingest from Procore → store in PG → answer questions" loop
4. 🟡 **Soul reality check** — update all 3 EVA souls based on confirmed API capabilities
5. 🟡 **nerv-deploy smoke test** — actually run `docker compose up` and fix what breaks
6. 🟢 **Katsuragi agent** — PM brain for workflow validation (tonight's task)
7. 🟢 **RFI sandbox scrub** — verify we have all RFIs (tonight's task)

## Honest Assessment

We have **excellent architecture and design** — the soul files, deployment template, update system, product theory, and naming are all sharp. The foundation is solid.

But we're in a **pre-MVP state**. The actual product (an agent that talks to Procore and answers PM questions) doesn't exist as running code yet. We've been building infrastructure and tooling (which was necessary) but the core value prop — "ask your agent about your project" — isn't demo-able today.

The good news: we're one auth click + one focused sprint away from a working prototype. The Procore API knowledge, database schema, and soul files are all there. We just need to wire them together.

**Bottom line:** Stop building more infrastructure. Get auth working. Build EVA-00's brain. Everything else is secondary.
