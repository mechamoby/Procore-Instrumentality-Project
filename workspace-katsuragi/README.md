# Katsuragi — Virtual PM Agent

Named after Misato Katsuragi — tactical operations director, the one who actually runs the show.

## Purpose

Internal-only agent that thinks like a GC project manager. Used to:
- Pressure-test EVA souls with realistic scenarios
- Generate PM-style questions and workflows
- Validate that EVA responses actually help a PM's day
- Simulate the kind of thinking a PM does at 6 AM with coffee and a punch list

## Status

- [ ] Nick brain dump on PM daily thinking
- [ ] SOUL.md written from brain dump
- [ ] Agent registered in gateway config
- [ ] First test conversation run

## Not for clients. Never ships. This is our sparring partner.
