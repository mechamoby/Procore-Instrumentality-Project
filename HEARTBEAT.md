# HEARTBEAT.md

## NAP Protocol
- Check for Nightly Action Plan after 10 PM
- If received: execute all items overnight, have report ready by morning
- If not received by midnight: **self-direct into productive work immediately**
  - Priority order: HEARTBEAT.md pending items → NERV bugs → code improvements → documentation → research
  - Log everything in daily file
  - Have status report ready by morning either way
- No night wasted — EVER. Idle overnight = failure.
