# SEELE Business Model v2 — The Digital Superintendent
*"Your projects make progress while you sleep."*
*Draft: February 24, 2026*

---

## The Concept

We sell an **always-on AI construction operator** — not software, not a chatbot, not a feature toggle. A dedicated digital team member that works 24/7, coordinates across every platform the client uses, and delivers results before the PM's morning coffee.

Procore's agents are a button inside their app. Ours is the superintendent running the night shift across the ENTIRE operation.

## The Name

**SEELE Construction Intelligence** (working name)
- Tagline: *"Your AI Night Crew"* or *"Projects don't sleep. Neither do we."*

## What The Client Gets

### The Digital PM (Model 1 DNA)
A configured AI operator that knows their projects, their workflows, their people, and their preferences. Not a generic tool — a team member that learns how THEY work.

**Day-to-day capabilities:**
- Submittal review + Procore draft creation (EVA-01)
- RFI response drafting with spec/drawing cross-reference (EVA-02)
- Email triage — flags urgent items, filters noise, drafts responses
- Document analysis — reads specs, contracts, change orders, highlights risks
- Vendor/sub research on demand
- Meeting prep — pulls relevant project data before owner meetings
- Daily log drafting from schedule + field data

### The Operations Center (Model 2 DNA)
Nick (and eventually hired operators) actively manages and tunes each client's AI. This isn't self-serve SaaS where the client figures it out. We run it for them.

**Managed services:**
- Weekly agent performance review and tuning
- Monthly strategy call with client PM team
- Escalation handling — when the AI hits something it can't solve, we step in
- New agent deployment as client needs evolve
- Integration management — connecting new tools, updating API credentials
- Quality assurance on AI output before it reaches the client

### The Night Crew (Model 5 DNA)
Every night, the AI processes the day's work and prepares tomorrow.

**Overnight processing:**
- Review all submittals received that day → draft responses for morning review
- Scan RFIs for response deadlines → flag overdue items → draft responses
- Generate daily log from schedule, weather, and available field data
- Process incoming emails → sort, flag, draft replies for urgent items
- Run compliance checks on recent documents
- Prepare morning briefing: priorities, deadlines, risks, action items
- Deliver morning report to PM's phone by 6 AM

## How It Works (Client Experience)

### Week 1: Onboarding
1. Nick meets client on-site. Understands their workflow, tools, team, pain points.
2. NERV box deployed on client network. Procore Drive bulk import for historical data.
3. Procore API configured. Email connected. Other tools integrated as needed.
4. AI operator configured with client-specific personality, workflow rules, and quality standards.
5. First night shift runs. Morning report delivered. Client gives feedback.

### Week 2-4: Calibration
- AI output reviewed daily by Nick before delivery to client
- Feedback loop tightens agent accuracy
- Additional workflows activated as trust builds
- Client team trained on how to interact with their AI operator (Telegram, email, NERV interface)

### Month 2+: Autonomous Operations
- AI runs independently with periodic human QA
- Monthly strategy calls
- New capabilities added based on client requests
- Agent learns and improves from ongoing project data

- Cheaper than a full-time hire
- Works 24/7 including nights, weekends, holidays
- Never calls in sick, never quits, never needs training twice
- Gets smarter over time — learns the client's preferences and workflows
- Overnight processing means projects move faster = earlier completion = saved carrying costs

## Sales Strategy

### The Procore Judo Move
Don't fight Procore. Use their momentum.

**Sales script:**
> "You've probably seen that Procore is adding AI agents to their platform. That's great — it proves the industry is moving this direction. Their agents handle basic tasks inside Procore. What they can't do is work across your email, your subs, your contracts, your schedule, and your documents all at once. And they definitely can't work the night shift. We're the layer that sits above all your tools — including Procore — and coordinates everything while your team sleeps."

### Trust Builders
- "Even Procore agrees AI agents are the future of construction management"
- "Your data stays on YOUR hardware, in YOUR office. We don't upload it anywhere."
- "Nick has managed projects like yours for 6 years. He configured your AI himself."
- "Try the Night Crew tier for one project, one month. See the morning report. Then decide."

### Target Clients (South Florida First)
1. **Mid-size GCs** ($20-100M annual volume) — big enough to need AI, small enough that Procore's enterprise approach underserves them
2. **International developers** building in South Florida — extra privacy concerns, multilingual needs
3. **Specialty contractors** with heavy submittal/RFI volume — MEP, curtain wall, fire protection
4. **Firms NOT on Procore** — using PlanGrid, Autodesk Build, or even just email/Excel. We work with anything.

### Entry Point
The Night Crew tier at $3,500/month is the foot in the door. Low commitment, high visibility (that morning report sells itself). Once they see it working, upsell to Digital PM or Operations Center.

## The Moat

1. **Relationships** — Nick's construction network in South Florida. Can't be replicated by a software company in California.
2. **Customization depth** — Each client's AI is configured by someone who understands construction PM workflows from the inside.
3. **Overnight processing** — Procore can't offer this. It's our signature feature.
4. **Platform agnostic** — We work with whatever the client uses. Not locked to Procore.
5. **Local data** — For privacy-conscious clients (government, military, international), this is non-negotiable.
6. **Switching cost** — Once the AI learns a client's workflows and preferences, switching is painful. The longer they use us, the better we get.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Procore bundles AI free | We offer cross-platform + overnight + managed service. Different product. |
| Client doesn't trust AI output | Human QA layer (Nick reviews before delivery). Build trust gradually. |
| Can't get first client | Offer first month free or heavily discounted. Use Nick's network. |
| Procore revokes API access | Diversify integrations. Build direct file/email ingest paths. |
| Nick can't manage >5 clients alone | Hire junior AI operators by Month 6. Train them on the playbook. |
| AI makes a mistake on a real project | Always require PM approval before anything is submitted. We draft, they approve. |

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize the pitch deck** — 10 slides, construction executive audience
2. **Complete EVA-01** — Must work flawlessly on real submittals
3. **Build the morning report pipeline** — This is the demo that sells itself
4. **Get production Procore access** — Need a real client or Nick's own Miller account
5. **Identify first 3 prospects** — From Nick's network, who would try this?
